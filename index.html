            <h2>Cultivating Life on the Moon</h2>
            <p>Lunar Gardens represent a groundbreaking approach to space exploration by integrating plant cultivation into lunar habitats. Unlike traditional space missions that rely solely on stored supplies, Lunar Gardens aim to create self-sustaining ecosystems where plants can grow under the unique conditions of the Moon's environment.</p>

                    <h3>Lunar Soil Composition</h3>
                    <p>The Moon's regolith, or soil, is composed primarily of fine-grained rock and mineral fragments, with a lack of organic matter. Researchers are exploring ways to mix lunar soil with organic materials or use hydroponic systems to grow plants without traditional soil.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Light Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Plants require light for photosynthesis. On the Moon, sunlight is intense but lacks the spectrum needed for optimal plant growth. Specialized LED grow lights are being developed to simulate Earth-like light conditions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Gravity Adaptation</h3>
                    <p>Lunar gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's. Plants must adapt to this reduced gravity, which can affect root growth and overall structure. Studies are ongoing to determine how different plant species fare under these conditions.</p>

            <h2>Key Challenges in Lunar Gardening</h2>
            <div class="challenge-list">
                <div class="challenge-item">
                    <h3>Limited Nutrient Availability</h3>
                    <p>Lunar soil lacks essential nutrients found in Earth's soil. Hydroponic and aeroponic systems are being explored to provide plants with all necessary nutrients through nutrient solutions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="challenge-item">
                    <h3>Temperature Extremes</h3>
                    <p>The Moon experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from -173°C (-280°F) at night to 127°C (260°F) during the day. Plants must be protected from these conditions, possibly with insulated habitats.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="challenge-item">
                    <h3>Water Management</h3>
                    <p>Water is a precious resource on the Moon. Efficient water recycling systems are essential to sustain plant growth and human life. Closed-loop systems are being developed to minimize water loss.</p>
